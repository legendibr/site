# Lesson 1 - Variables

In the algebraic expression $4s$, the letter $s$ is called a **variable**. In algebra, variables are symbols used to represent unspecified numbers or values. Any letter may be used as a variable. The letter $s$ was used above because it is the first letter of the word side.

An algebraic expression consists of one or more numbers and variables along with one or more **arithmetic operations**. Here are some examples of algebraic expressions:

- $5x$
- $3х - 7$
- $4+$
- $m × 5n$
- $3ab ÷ 5cd$

In algebraic expressions, a raised dot or parentheses are often used to indicate **multiplication** as the symbol x can be easily mistaken for the letter x. Here are several ways to represent the product of x and y:

- $xy$
- $х • y$
- $х(y)$
- $(x) y$
- $(x) (y)$

In each expression, the quantities being multiplied are called **factors**, and the result is called the product.
An expression like $x^n$ is raised is called a **power**. The variable $x$ is called the **base**, and $n$ is called the **exponent**. The word power can also refer to the exponent. The exponent indicates the number of times the base is used as a factor. The expression $x^n$ is read "$x$ to the $n$th power."
