# Geometry Practice: Rigid Transformations

## 1. Translation
A triangle has vertices at \( A(2, 3) \), \( B(4, 5) \), and \( C(6, 1) \). Translate the triangle 3 units to the right and 2 units down.  
- Write the new coordinates of \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
- Plot both the original and translated triangles on a coordinate plane.

---

## 2. Reflection
Reflect the point \( P(-4, 5) \) over:
1. The x-axis
2. The y-axis
3. The line \( y = x \)

- Write the coordinates of the reflected points for each case.

---

## 3. Rotation
A quadrilateral has vertices at \( Q(1, 2) \), \( R(3, 4) \), \( S(2, 5) \), and \( T(0, 3) \). Rotate the quadrilateral \( 90^\circ \) counterclockwise about the origin.  
- Write the new coordinates of \( Q \), \( R \), \( S \), and \( T \).
- Explain how the coordinates change when rotating \( 90^\circ \) counterclockwise.

---

## 4. Combination of Transformations
A figure is first translated 5 units up and 4 units left, then rotated \( 180^\circ \) about the origin.  
If the original figure has a point at \( K(3, -2) \), what are the coordinates of the point after both transformations?

---

## 5. Identifying Transformations
The points \( A(1, 2) \), \( B(3, 4) \), and \( C(5, 2) \) are transformed to \( A'(1, -2) \), \( B'(3, -4) \), and \( C'(5, -2) \).  
- Identify the rigid transformation performed.
- Explain your reasoning.

---

## 6. Properties of Rigid Transformations
Determine whether the following statements about rigid transformations are true or false. If false, provide a counterexample:
1. Rigid transformations preserve the distance between points.
2. A translation always changes the orientation of a figure.
3. A reflection over the x-axis and then the y-axis is equivalent to a \( 180^\circ \) rotation about the origin.

---

## 7. Creating Transformations
Create your own figure on a coordinate plane with at least 3 vertices.  
1. Apply a reflection over the line \( x = 2 \).  
2. Translate the figure 4 units down.  
3. Rotate the figure \( 90^\circ \) clockwise about the origin.  

- Provide the coordinates of the vertices after each transformation.
- Discuss whether the figure's shape and size changed after each transformation.

### Bonus Challenge
Describe a sequence of rigid transformations that maps \( \triangle ABC \) with vertices \( A(0, 0) \), \( B(2, 3) \), \( C(4, 1) \) to \( \triangle A'B'C' \) with vertices \( A'(2, -2) \), \( B'(4, 1) \), \( C'(6, -1) \).
