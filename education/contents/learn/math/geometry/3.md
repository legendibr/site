# Basic Trigonometry in Right Triangles

Trigonometry is the study of relationships between the angles and sides of triangles. In right triangles, the trigonometric ratios sine (sin), cosine (cos), and tangent (tan) are used to find missing sides or angles.

## Key Trigonometric Ratios
For a right triangle:
1. **Sine (sin):**
   \[
   \sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
   \]
2. **Cosine (cos):**
   \[
   \cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
   \]
3. **Tangent (tan):**
   \[
   \tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}
   \]

### Definitions
- **Hypotenuse:** The longest side, opposite the right angle.
- **Opposite:** The side opposite the angle \(\theta\).
- **Adjacent:** The side next to \(\theta\), but not the hypotenuse.

## Solving for Missing Sides

### 1. Finding the Opposite Side
If you know the hypotenuse and an angle \(\theta\):
\[
\text{opposite} = \sin(\theta) \cdot \text{hypotenuse}
\]

**Example:**
A triangle has a hypotenuse of 10 units, and \(\theta = 30^\circ\). Find the opposite side.
\[
\text{opposite} = \sin(30^\circ) \cdot 10 = 0.5 \cdot 10 = 5 \text{ units}
\]

---

### 2. Finding the Adjacent Side
If you know the hypotenuse and an angle \(\theta\):
\[
\text{adjacent} = \cos(\theta) \cdot \text{hypotenuse}
\]

**Example:**
A triangle has a hypotenuse of 10 units, and \(\theta = 60^\circ\). Find the adjacent side.
\[
\text{adjacent} = \cos(60^\circ) \cdot 10 = 0.5 \cdot 10 = 5 \text{ units}
\]

---

### 3. Finding the Hypotenuse
If you know the adjacent side and an angle \(\theta\):
\[
\text{hypotenuse} = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\cos(\theta)}
\]

**Example:**
A triangle has an adjacent side of 4 units, and \(\theta = 45^\circ\). Find the hypotenuse.
\[
\text{hypotenuse} = \frac{4}{\cos(45^\circ)} = \frac{4}{0.707} \approx 5.66 \text{ units}
\]

## Solving for Missing Angles
If you know two sides, you can find the angle using the inverse trigonometric functions \(\sin^{-1}, \cos^{-1}, \tan^{-1}\).

**Example:**
A triangle has an opposite side of 3 units and a hypotenuse of 5 units. Find \(\theta\).
\[
\sin(\theta) = \frac{3}{5}
\]
\[
\theta = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{3}{5}\right) \approx 36.87^\circ
\]

## Practice Problems
1. A triangle has a hypotenuse of 13 units and an angle \(\theta = 22^\circ\). Find the opposite side.
2. A triangle has an adjacent side of 7 units and an angle \(\theta = 45^\circ\). Find the hypotenuse.
3. A triangle has an opposite side of 5 units and an adjacent side of 12 units. Find \(\theta\).

## Solutions
1. \[
\text{opposite} = \sin(22^\circ) \cdot 13 \approx 4.87 \text{ units}
\]
2. \[
\text{hypotenuse} = \frac{7}{\cos(45^\circ)} = \frac{7}{0.707} \approx 9.9 \text{ units}
\]
3. \[
\tan(\theta) = \frac{5}{12}, \quad \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{5}{12}\right) \approx 22.62^\circ
\]

## Tips for Using Trigonometry
1. Make sure your calculator is in the correct mode (degrees or radians).
2. Label the sides relative to the angle you are working with.
3. Use diagrams to visualize the problem clearly.
