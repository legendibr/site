# Practice Questions: Asymptotes

---

## **Find the Asymptotes**
1. Identify the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the following functions:
   - \(f(x) = \frac{5}{x - 3}\)
   - \(f(x) = \frac{x^2 - 4}{x^2 + 1}\)
   - \(f(x) = \frac{2x + 1}{x^2 - 9}\)

2. For \(f(x) = \frac{x^2 + 2x - 3}{x + 1}\):
   - Find the vertical asymptote(s), if any.
   - Determine whether there is a horizontal or oblique asymptote.

## **Graph Analysis**
3. A graph of a rational function passes through the points \((1, 4)\) and \((-2, -1)\). It has:
   - A vertical asymptote at \(x = 0\),
   - A horizontal asymptote at \(y = 2\).

   Sketch the function based on this information.

4. The function \(f(x) = \frac{3x^2 + 5}{x - 2}\):
   - Find all asymptotes (vertical, horizontal, or oblique).
   - Sketch the asymptotes and predict the graph's behavior around them.

## **Practice on Real-World Scenarios**
5. A companyâ€™s profit (\(P\)) in thousands of dollars depends on the number of items (\(x\)) they sell and is modeled by the function:
   \[
   P(x) = \frac{200x}{x + 50}
   \]
   - Identify the horizontal asymptote and explain what it represents in this context.
   - Determine if there are any vertical asymptotes.

6. A tank is being emptied, and the height of the water (\(h\)) as a function of time (\(t\)) is modeled by:
   \[
   h(t) = \frac{50}{t + 1}
   \]
   - What happens to the height of the water as \(t \to \infty\)?
   - What is the vertical asymptote of the function?

## **Challenge Questions**
7. Determine the asymptotes and sketch the graph of \(f(x) = \frac{x^2 + 3x - 10}{x^2 - 4x + 4}\).

8. The function \(f(x) = \frac{2x^2 + 5x + 3}{x + 1}\) is given:
   - Perform polynomial long division to find the oblique asymptote.
   - Describe the behavior of the graph as \(x \to \infty\) and \(x \to -\infty\).
