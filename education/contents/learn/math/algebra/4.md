# Algebra 2: Understanding Asymptotes

## Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Define vertical, horizontal, and oblique asymptotes.
2. Identify asymptotes for rational functions.
3. Sketch the general shape of a graph based on its asymptotes.

## Key Concepts

### 1. What are Asymptotes?
Asymptotes are lines that a graph approaches but never touches. They represent the behavior of the function as \(x\) or \(y\) approaches infinity.

#### Types of Asymptotes:
1. **Vertical Asymptote (VA)**:
   - Occurs when the function becomes undefined at certain \(x\)-values.
   - Found by setting the denominator equal to 0 in a rational function.
   - Example: For \(f(x) = \frac{1}{x - 2}\), the vertical asymptote is at \(x = 2\).

2. **Horizontal Asymptote (HA)**:
   - Represents the behavior of the function as \(x\) approaches \(+\infty\) or \(-\infty\).
   - Determined by comparing the degrees of the numerator and denominator.
     - If the degree of the numerator (\(n\)) is less than the degree of the denominator (\(m\)): \(y = 0\).
     - If \(n = m\): \(y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of numerator}}{\text{leading coefficient of denominator}}\).
     - If \(n > m\): No horizontal asymptote (there may be an oblique asymptote instead).

3. **Oblique (Slant) Asymptote (OA)**:
   - Occurs when the degree of the numerator is exactly one greater than the degree of the denominator (\(n = m + 1\)).
   - Found by dividing the numerator by the denominator using polynomial long division.

## How to Find Asymptotes

### Step-by-Step Guide for Rational Functions

#### Example 1: \(f(x) = \frac{2x + 3}{x - 1}\)
1. **Vertical Asymptote**:
   - Set the denominator equal to 0: \(x - 1 = 0\).
   - VA: \(x = 1\).

2. **Horizontal Asymptote**:
   - The degree of the numerator and denominator are both 1 (\(n = m\)).
   - HA: \(y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of numerator}}{\text{leading coefficient of denominator}} = \frac{2}{1} = 2\).

3. **Oblique Asymptote**:
   - Not applicable since the degrees are equal.

---

#### Example 2: \(f(x) = \frac{x^2 + 5}{x - 2}\)
1. **Vertical Asymptote**:
   - Set the denominator equal to 0: \(x - 2 = 0\).
   - VA: \(x = 2\).

2. **Horizontal Asymptote**:
   - The degree of the numerator (\(n = 2\)) is greater than the degree of the denominator (\(m = 1\)).
   - No horizontal asymptote.

3. **Oblique Asymptote**:
   - Divide \(x^2 + 5\) by \(x - 2\) using long division:
     \[
     \frac{x^2 + 5}{x - 2} = x + 2 + \frac{9}{x - 2}
     \]
   - OA: \(y = x + 2\).

### 3. Graphing with Asymptotes
1. Plot the asymptotes on the graph.
2. Identify key points around the asymptotes to determine the function's behavior.
3. Sketch the curve, ensuring it approaches the asymptotes but doesn’t touch them.

---

## Practice Problems

1. Identify the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of \(f(x) = \frac{3x}{x^2 - 4}\).
2. Find the oblique asymptote of \(f(x) = \frac{x^2 + 4x + 3}{x - 1}\).
3. Sketch the graph of \(f(x) = \frac{2x^2}{x^2 + 1}\).

---

## Summary
- Vertical asymptotes occur where the function is undefined.
- Horizontal asymptotes describe the end behavior of the function.
- Oblique asymptotes occur when the numerator’s degree is one higher than the denominator’s degree.
