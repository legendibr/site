# Similarity and Dilation in Geometry

Similarity and dilation are key concepts in geometry that deal with proportionality and resizing figures while maintaining their shape.

## Key Properties of Similar Figures
1. **Proportional Sides:** The ratios of corresponding side lengths are equal.
2. **Equal Angles:** Corresponding angles in similar figures are congruent.

---

## Dilation
Dilation is a transformation that resizes a figure by a scale factor relative to a fixed point called the **center of dilation**. The shape of the figure remains the same, but the size changes.

### Scale Factor
- If the scale factor \(k > 1\), the figure enlarges.
- If \(0 < k < 1\), the figure shrinks.
- If \(k = 1\), the figure remains unchanged.

**Rule:**
For a point \((x, y)\), a dilation with center \((h, k)\) and scale factor \(k\) gives:
\[
(x, y) \to (h + k(x - h), k + k(y - k))
\]
If the center of dilation is the origin \((0, 0)\):
\[
(x, y) \to (kx, ky)
\]

**Example:**
If a triangle has vertices \((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)\), and we apply a dilation with a scale factor \(k = 2\) and center \((0, 0)\):
- \((1 \cdot 2, 2 \cdot 2) = (2, 4)\)
- \((3 \cdot 2, 4 \cdot 2) = (6, 8)\)
- \((5 \cdot 2, 6 \cdot 2) = (10, 12)\)

## Verifying Similarity
Figures are similar if they satisfy the **Angle-Angle (AA)** similarity criterion or proportional side ratios.

### Proving Similarity
1. **Angle-Angle (AA) Criterion:**
   Two figures are similar if two corresponding angles are congruent.

2. **Side-Side-Side (SSS) Similarity Criterion:**
   Two figures are similar if all corresponding side lengths are proportional.

3. **Side-Angle-Side (SAS) Similarity Criterion:**
   Two figures are similar if one pair of corresponding angles is congruent and the corresponding sides around the angle are proportional.

**Example:**
Given two triangles with side lengths \(3, 4, 5\) and \(6, 8, 10\), prove they are similar using the SSS criterion.

- Ratios of corresponding sides:
  \[
  \frac{3}{6} = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2}
  \]
- Since the side lengths are proportional, the triangles are similar.

## Visualizing Similarity and Dilation
Use tools like graph paper or software (e.g., GeoGebra) to plot the original and transformed figures. Experiment with different centers and scale factors to understand the effects of dilation.

Similarity and dilation are critical for understanding scaling, proportions, and real-world applications like map-making and model creation. Master these concepts to excel in geometry!
