# Lesson 3 - The FOIL Method

In this lesson, we learned how to factor a trinomial of the form: $ax^2 + bx + c, a ≠ 1$, using the FOIL method, which stands for first, outer, inner, last

Process:
1. $(2x - 5)(x + 7)$
2. F: $2x • x = 2x2$
3. O: $2x • 7 = 14x$
4. I: $-5 • x = -5x$
5. L: $-5 • 7 = -35$

When we combine like terms we get $2x2 + 9x - 35$

To reverse the FOIL process, we first think about the F in FOIL.
Since $2$, the coefficient of $x2$ is a prime number, our job is a bit easier. To get $2x^2$, we multiply $2x • x$:

$(2x +$ __ $)$$(x +$ __ $)$

Now we need to find the missing two integers. We must think about factors of the constant term $(-35)$, that will give us the correct middle term $(9x)$.

$-35$:
$-1 • 35$ or $1 • -35$
$5 • -7$ or $-5 • 7$

At this point, we only need to work out the O and I steps, they must sum to $(+9x)$:

$(2x +$ __ $)$$(x +$ __$)$
O » $2x •$ __
I » __ $• x$

We will start by working with $-1$ and $35$, we have two scenarios:
$(2x - 1)(x + 35)$
$(2x + 35)(x - 1)$
