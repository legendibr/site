## Key Concepts

### 1. What is a Quadratic Equation?
A quadratic equation is a polynomial equation of degree 2. The standard form is:

\[
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
\]

- \(a, b, c\) are constants.
- \(a \neq 0\).

### 2. Methods to Solve Quadratic Equations

#### **A. Factoring**
Example:
\[
x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0
\]
Steps:
1. Find two numbers that multiply to \(c\) (6) and add to \(b\) (5).
   - Numbers: 2 and 3.
2. Rewrite the equation:
   \[
   (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0
   \]
3. Solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x + 2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 3 = 0
   \]
   \[
   x = -2 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -3
   \]

#### **B. Completing the Square**
Example:
\[
x^2 + 6x + 5 = 0
\]
Steps:
1. Move the constant to the other side:
   \[
   x^2 + 6x = -5
   \]
2. Add \(\left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2\) to both sides:
   \[
   x^2 + 6x + 9 = 4
   \]
3. Factor the left-hand side:
   \[
   (x + 3)^2 = 4
   \]
4. Solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x + 3 = \pm 2
   \]
   \[
   x = -3 + 2 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -3 - 2
   \]
   \[
   x = -1 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -5
   \]

#### **C. Quadratic Formula**
The quadratic formula is:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]
Example:
\[
2x^2 + 4x - 6 = 0
\]
Steps:
1. Identify coefficients:
   \[
   a = 2, \, b = 4, \, c = -6
   \]
2. Plug into the formula:
   \[
   x = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4(2)(-6)}}{2(2)}
   \]
3. Simplify:
   \[
   x = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 48}}{4}
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{64}}{4}
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{-4 \pm 8}{4}
   \]
4. Solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 1 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -3
   \]

## Graphing Quadratic Equations

1. The graph of a quadratic equation is a parabola.
2. **Key Features**:
   - **Vertex**: The highest or lowest point.
   - **Axis of Symmetry**: A vertical line through the vertex.
   - **Intercepts**:
     - **x-intercepts**: Solutions to the equation.
     - **y-intercept**: The value of \(y\) when \(x = 0\).

Example: Graph \(y = x^2 - 4x + 3\)
- Vertex: \((2, -1)\)
- Axis of Symmetry: \(x = 2\)
- x-intercepts: \(x = 1, 3\)
- y-intercept: \(y = 3\)

---

## Practice Problems
1. Solve \(x^2 - 7x + 10 = 0\) by factoring.
2. Solve \(x^2 + 4x + 1 = 0\) by completing the square.
3. Solve \(3x^2 - 5x + 2 = 0\) using the quadratic formula.
4. Graph \(y = -x^2 + 2x + 3\) and label its key features.

---

## Summary
- Quadratic equations can be solved using various methods: factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula.
- The graph of a quadratic equation is a parabola with identifiable features like the vertex, axis of symmetry, and intercepts.
