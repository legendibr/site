# Lesson 2 - Functions

In a function, the output depends on the input. There is exactly one output for each input. A function is graphed using a **coordinate system**, or coordinate plane. It is formed by the intersection of two number lines, the horizontal axis and the vertical axis.

Each input $x$ and its corresponding output $y$ is graphed using an ordered pair in the form $(x, y)$. The $x$-value, called the **$x$-coordinate** corresponds to the $x$-axis and the $y$-value, or **$y$-coordinate**, corresponds to the $y$-axis.

A function is often denoted by a letter such as $f$, $g$ or $h$. The value of a function $f$ at an element $x$ of its domain (that is, the element of the codomain that is associated with $x$) is denoted by $f(x)$; for example, the value of $f$ at $x = 4$ is denoted by $f(4)$. Commonly, a specific function is defined by means of an expression depending on $x$, such as $f(x) = x^2 + 1$; in this case, some computation, called **function evaluation**, may be needed for deducing the value of the function at a particular value; for example, if $f(x) = x^2 + 1$, then $f(4)= 4^2 + 1= 17$

Functions are widely used in science, engineering, and in most fields of mathematics. It has been said that functions are "the central objects of investigation" in most fields of mathematics.
