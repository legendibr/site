# Geometry Practice: Dilation and Similarity

## 1. Dilation
A triangle has vertices at \( A(1, 2) \), \( B(3, 4) \), and \( C(5, 2) \). Perform a dilation with a scale factor of \( k = 2 \) centered at the origin.  
- Write the new coordinates of \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
- Plot both the original and dilated triangles on a coordinate plane.

---

## 2. Dilation with a Non-Origin Center
A rectangle has vertices at \( P(2, 1) \), \( Q(4, 1) \), \( R(4, 3) \), and \( S(2, 3) \). Dilate the rectangle with a scale factor of \( k = \frac{1}{2} \) centered at \( (3, 2) \).  
- Write the new coordinates of \( P \), \( Q \), \( R \), and \( S \).
- Describe how the location and size of the rectangle change.

## 3. Similarity and Scale Factors
Two triangles are similar, with a scale factor of \( k = 3 \).  
The smaller triangle has sides of lengths \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 6 \).  
- Find the lengths of the corresponding sides of the larger triangle.
- Verify that the ratios of the corresponding sides are consistent with the scale factor.

## 4. Identifying Similar Triangles
Given two triangles \( \triangle ABC \) and \( \triangle DEF \):
- \( AB = 6 \), \( BC = 8 \), \( AC = 10 \)
- \( DE = 9 \), \( EF = 12 \), \( DF = 15 \)

1. Are the triangles similar? If so, explain why and state the similarity ratio.  
2. Write the corresponding vertices of the triangles.

## 5. Real-World Application of Similarity
A building casts a shadow that is 30 meters long. At the same time, a 2-meter-tall lamppost casts a shadow that is 3 meters long.  
- How tall is the building?  
- Explain how you used the concept of similar triangles to solve the problem.

## 6. Mapping Figures Using Dilation
A figure has vertices at \( A(-1, 0) \), \( B(0, 2) \), and \( C(2, 1) \).  
1. Apply a dilation with a scale factor of \( k = 3 \) centered at the origin.  
2. Apply a second dilation with a scale factor of \( k = \frac{1}{2} \) centered at \( (1, 1) \).  
- Write the coordinates of the vertices after each transformation.  
- Compare the shapes and sizes of the figures after each dilation.

---

## 7. Conditions for Similarity
Determine whether the following statements are true or false. If false, explain why:
1. If two figures are similar, their angles are congruent.  
2. Dilation always preserves the size of a figure.  
3. Two rectangles are always similar.  
4. A dilation can change the orientation of a figure.

---

## 8. Sequence of Transformations
A triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is dilated with a scale factor of \( k = 2 \) centered at the origin, and then reflected over the x-axis.  
If \( A(1, 2) \), \( B(3, 4) \), and \( C(5, 2) \) are the vertices of the original triangle, what are the coordinates of the vertices after the sequence of transformations?  
- Explain how the dilation and reflection affect the size, orientation, and position of the triangle.

---

### Bonus Challenge
Given \( \triangle XYZ \) with vertices \( X(0, 0) \), \( Y(4, 0) \), and \( Z(4, 3) \), describe a sequence of transformations (including dilation and rigid transformations) that maps \( \triangle XYZ \) to \( \triangle X'Y'Z' \) with vertices \( X'(2, 1) \), \( Y'(4, 1) \), and \( Z'(4, 3) \).  
- Be sure to specify the scale factor, center of dilation, and any additional transformations.
