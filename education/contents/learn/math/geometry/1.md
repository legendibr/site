# Rigid Transformations in Geometry

Rigid transformations are movements of geometric figures that preserve their shape and size. They are fundamental in high school geometry and include translations, rotations, and reflections.

## Key Properties of Rigid Transformations
1. **Distance Preservation:** The distance between any two points remains the same after the transformation.
2. **Angle Preservation:** The angles in the geometric figure remain unchanged.
3. **Orientation:** Depending on the transformation, the orientation of the figure may or may not change.

## Types of Rigid Transformations

### 1. Translation
A translation moves a figure in a straight line from one position to another without turning it. Every point of the figure moves the same distance in the same direction.

**Rule:**
- A point \((x, y)\) after a translation by \(a\) units horizontally and \(b\) units vertically becomes:
  \[ (x, y) \to (x + a, y + b) \]

**Example:**
If a triangle has vertices \((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)\), and we translate it by \(a = 2\), \(b = -1\), the new vertices are:
- \((1+2, 2-1) = (3, 1)\)
- \((3+2, 4-1) = (5, 3)\)
- \((5+2, 6-1) = (7, 5)\)

---

### 2. Rotation
A rotation turns a figure around a fixed point called the center of rotation. The figure remains congruent to itself.

**Common Rotations Around the Origin:**
- \(90^\circ\) clockwise: \((x, y) \to (y, -x)\)
- \(90^\circ\) counterclockwise: \((x, y) \to (-y, x)\)
- \(180^\circ\): \((x, y) \to (-x, -y)\)

**Example:**
If a point \((2, 3)\) is rotated \(90^\circ\) counterclockwise around the origin, the new position is:
\[ (2, 3) \to (-3, 2) \]

---

### 3. Reflection
A reflection flips a figure over a line, such as the x-axis, y-axis, or any other line.

**Common Reflections:**
- Over the x-axis: \((x, y) \to (x, -y)\)
- Over the y-axis: \((x, y) \to (-x, y)\)
- Over the line \(y = x\): \((x, y) \to (y, x)\)

**Example:**
Reflecting the point \((4, 5)\) over the x-axis results in:
\[ (4, 5) \to (4, -5) \]

---

## Practice Problems
1. Translate the point \((3, 7)\) by \(-2\) units horizontally and \(4\) units vertically.
2. Rotate the point \((-1, 5)\) by \(180^\circ\) around the origin.
3. Reflect the triangle with vertices \((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)\) over the y-axis.

## Solutions
1. \((3-2, 7+4) = (1, 11)\)
2. \((-1, 5) \to (1, -5)\)
3. \((1, 2) \to (-1, 2), (3, 4) \to (-3, 4), (5, 6) \to (-5, 6)\)

## Visualizing Rigid Transformations
Using graph paper or tools like GeoGebra can help you better understand rigid transformations. Plot the original and transformed figures to see the effect of each transformation.

Rigid transformations are essential for understanding congruence, symmetry, and the relationships between geometric figures. Mastering them will set a strong foundation for more advanced topics in geometry.
